## üöÄ Overview

The Fake GPU Operator is a lightweight tool that simulates NVIDIA GPUs in Kubernetes clusters without requiring physical hardware. It provides basic functionality for developers and testers:

- Simulates virtual GPUs on CPU-only nodes
- Supports basic feature discovery and NVIDIA MIG support
- Generates Prometheus metrics for GPU monitoring
- Reduces hardware costs for testing environments

Use cases include:
- Testing GPU-dependent applications
- CI/CD pipeline testing
- Development environments
- Learning and experimentation

## ‚ú® Features

- Basic GPU topology simulation
- Prometheus metrics generation
- NVIDIA MIG simulation support
- Configurable GPU types and memory
- Basic nvidia-smi simulation

## üèÉ Quick Start
